        includes protecting our rights, safety, and property, as well as the
        rights, safety, and property of our users or any other third parties. We
        may aggregate and anonymize your information to create statistical or
        aggregated data that does not personally identify you. This aggregated
        and anonymized data may be used for various purposes, such as analyzing
        usage patterns, improving our Services, or conducting market research,
        or sharing with third parties for lawful purposes. 3. LEGAL BASES FOR
        PROCESSING YOUR INFORMATION In compliance with the California Consumer
        Privacy Act (CCPA) and the Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act
        (COPPA), JagCom outlines the legal bases for processing your
        information. The App adheres to stringent privacy standards, ensuring
        that the collection and processing of user information are conducted
        within the framework of applicable data protection laws. a. CCPA
        Compliance: Under the CCPA, the processing of personal information is
        based on several legal grounds, including: • Consent: Where applicable,
        JagCom seeks explicit consent from users for the collection and
        processing of their personal information. Users have the right to
        withdraw their consent at any time. • Contractual Necessity: Processing
        may occur to fulfill contractual obligations with users. For example,
        processing personal information is necessary to provide the requested
        services within the App. • Legitimate Interests: Some processing
        activities are based on JagCom&apos;s legitimate interests, such as
        enhancing the functionality of the App, improving user experience, and
        ensuring the security of user data. • Legal Obligations: Information may
        be processed to comply with legal obligations imposed on JagCom. b.
        COPPA Compliance: In accordance with COPPA, JagCom specifically
        addresses the processing of information for users under the age of 13: •
        Verifiable Parental Consent: For users under 13, JagCom obtains
        verifiable parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing
        personal information. This consent is a crucial legal basis for
        processing information under COPPA. Upon initial setup, all new users
        encounter a birthdate entry screen, where they are required to input
        their date of birth. This step serves a critical purpose, as the App
        automatically calculates the user&apos;s age to verify that they are at
        least 13 years old. This age verification process is essential for
        complying with online privacy laws that specifically safeguard minors,
        as outlined by COPPA. While COPPA&apos;s parental consent requirements
        are specifically targeted at children under 13, JagCom extends its
        commitment to transparency and data privacy to users of all ages. The
        age verification step underscores our dedication to creating a secure
        digital space for everyone, promoting responsible online practices, and
        prioritizing the protection of user information. • Necessary for the
        Operation of the Service: Information processing for users under 13 is
        limited to what is reasonably necessary for the operation of the App.
        This includes providing age-appropriate content and ensuring a safe
        online environment for younger users. • Security and Integrity of Data:
        Processing is also based on the need to maintain the security and
        integrity of user data, ensuring a protected environment for all users,
        especially children. c. We may process your information where we believe
        it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to
        cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or
        defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in
        litigation in which we are involved. d. We may also process your
        information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital
        interests or the vital interests of a third party such as situations
        involving potential threats to the safety of any person. JagCom is
        committed to upholding the rights and protections afforded by the CCPA
        and COPPA. Users are encouraged to review the app&apos;s Privacy Policy
        for comprehensive details on the legal bases for processing personal
        information, including their rights and options in managing their data
        within the App. 4. HOW DATA WILL BE COLLECTED a. We collect personal
        data authenticated through Google, to strategically fulfill key roles
        within the App&apos;s ecosystem. The primary purpose of gathering this
        information is to facilitate a robust and reliable messaging service,
        enhancing the overall user experience for students. The collected data
        is used to ensure a seamless and personalized interaction within the
        App. Specifically, the personal data authenticated through Google plays
        a crucial role in enabling students to identify and communicate
        effectively with their peers or counselors. b. One key feature
        contributing to this personalized experience is the option for students
        to set their counselor in the App&apos;s settings. This customization
        further tailors interactions, providing students with more targeted and
        relevant engagements. By incorporating this user-specific information,
        JagCom aims to enhance the functionality of the App, acknowledging the
        diverse needs and preferences of its users. c. The integration of this
        data also serves the dual purpose of ensuring secure interactions within
        the App. When a student engages in conversations or participates in club
        activities, their name and email address are prominently displayed. This
        visibility not only fosters a sense of accountability but also
        contributes to the overall security of the platform, assuring users that
        the information shared within the App is contextually relevant and
        trustworthy. 5. ANALYTICS TOOLS FOR OPERATIONAL PURPOSES JagCom may
        employ analytics tools for operational purposes. These tools serve
        essential functions, including monitoring app performance, analyzing
        user interactions, and improving overall functionality. The use of
        analytics tools, specifically for app store analytics, allows JagCom to
        gather valuable insights into how users interact with the application.
        This information is instrumental in identifying areas for improvement,
        enhancing features, and addressing potential issues to provide a more
        seamless and efficient experience. It&apos;s important to note that
        while analytics tools are utilized, the data collected is aggregated and
        anonymized to ensure the privacy of individual users. These tools focus
        on broad trends and patterns rather than personal identifiers. 6. WHEN
        AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION? We may need to
        share your personal information in the following situations: a. Business
        Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with,
        or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing
        or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
        b. Other Users. When you share personal information (for example, by
        posting comments, contributions, or other content to the App) or
        otherwise interact with public areas of the App, such personal
        information may be viewed by other users and may be publicly made
        available. Understanding the identity of individuals you interact with,
        be it a counselor or fellow student, is fundamental for a trusted and
        reliable experience. To achieve this, JagCom employs a secure Google
        Authentication process. When you engage in interactions on the App, your
        name and email address, authenticated through Google, are automatically
        stored in our database. This ensures a seamless and trustworthy
        communication experience within the App. If you interact with other
        users of the App and register for the App through a social network (such
        as Facebook), your contacts on the social network may see your user
        information. 7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION? We will only keep
        your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
        purposes set out in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is
        required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
        requirements). No purpose in this Policy will require us keeping your
        personal information for longer than twelve (12) months past the
        termination of the user&apos;s account. When we have no ongoing
        legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
        either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible
        (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
        backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
        and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
        8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE? We have implemented appropriate
        and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed
        to protect the security of any personal information we process. To
        uphold the safety and privacy of student data within JagCom, we
        implement robust security measures, particularly in the storage and
        management of data through Firebase. Firebase, a platform developed by
        Google, is renowned for its strong security features. The following
        highlights key aspects of how JagCom utilizes Firebase to ensure the
        security of student data: a. Data Encryption: All data, encompassing
        emails, names, messages, and other student information, undergoes
        encryption both in transit and at rest. This means that the data is
        shielded from unauthorized access during transmission to and from
        Firebase, as well as while stored in Firebase databases. b.
        Authentication: Firebase Authentication provides a secure and
        user-friendly login method for JagCom users. Supporting various
        authentication methods, including email and password, and seamlessly
        integrating with Google sign-in, it guarantees that only authorized
        users can access the app securely. c. Regular Updates and Maintenance:
        JagCom benefits from the platform&apos;s routine security updates,
        protecting against emerging vulnerabilities and threats. This proactive
        approach ensures ongoing defense against evolving security challenges.
        d. Access Controls and Permissions: Firebase allows for the meticulous
        configuration of access controls, ensuring that only authorized
        personnel can access sensitive student data. This feature is pivotal in
        preventing unauthorized access or potential data breaches. e. Community
        and Support: As a Google product, Firebase boasts a sizable community
        and extensive support resources. This ensures swift resolution of any
        security concerns that may arise, contributing to the overall
        reliability of JagCom&apos;s security infrastructure. Additionally, here
        are specific details regarding encryption methods and secure storage
        practices, as well as the preventive measures taken against unauthorized
        access or data breaches: a. For data at rest, JagCom employs
        Firebase&apos;s built-in encryption, automatically encrypting all stored
        data, including emails, names, and messages. This proactive measure
        safeguards against unauthorized access and potential breaches. b. JagCom
        implements several measures to prevent unauthorized access and data
        breaches, with a primary emphasis on integration with Firebase and
        Google Sign-in for secure authentication. Google Sign-in, utilizing
        industry-standard protocols and techniques, ensures the protection of
        user credentials. Furthermore, Firebase, as the backend, employs SSL
        (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption for all data in transit, establishing
        a secure channel between the user&apos;s device and the Firebase
        servers. This setup effectively guards against common cyber threats such
        as man-in-the-middle attacks. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
        a secure environment. It&apos;s essential to note that while messages
        are securely stored, they remain accessible to designated school
        administrators. This access is granted to authorized personnel to
        support the effective administration and oversight of communication
        within the App. School admins may need to review messages for purposes
        such as ensuring compliance with school policies, addressing concerns,
        or providing assistance to users. The security and confidentiality of
        your messages are of utmost importance to us. JagCom employs robust
        security measures, including data encryption and access controls, to
        safeguard the integrity and privacy of the messages stored in our
        database. These measures are designed to prevent unauthorized access and
        protect the sensitive nature of communication within the educational
        community. 9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS? a. You may review, change,

        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice ima revised version of this privacy notice. 11. CALIFORNIA
